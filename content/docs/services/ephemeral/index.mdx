- Tab Cloaking - Changeable Title, Icon, and About:blank cloaking
- Customizable! - Ephemeral has tons of other customization options for you to play with to match your preferences!
- _More coming soon! ;)_

    Make sure that you have NodeJS 18.x installed to check this in your
    operating system of choice command line or terminal type: `Node --Version`
    and if it says 18.0.0 or anything later than that you are fine. If you need
    to install or update NodeJS Please Refer to [This
