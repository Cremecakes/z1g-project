Hosting Ephemeral on a static host is really easy.

<Steps>
<Step>
## Configuring the host
Configure your host to build the project using `pnpm build` and point the output directory to `dist`. If they have a "Vite" option, use that.

<Step>
## Defining the Wisp Server
In your host, there should be a way of setting environment variables. Set the `VITE_WISP_SERVER` variable to a Wisp server URL.
