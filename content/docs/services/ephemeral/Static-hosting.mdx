description: Using Ephemeral on a static hosting provider

Hosting Ephemeral on a static host is really easy on most hosts. 
When you go to deploy the repository, you can specify the build command to `pnpm build` and the public directory to `dist`. This will build the site and output it to the `dist` directory. 
If your provider has a vite preset (like Vercel), you can use that to automatically build the site for you. Make sure to set the `VITE_WISP_SERVER` environment variable to a public wisp server.
