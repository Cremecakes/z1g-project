## What does this mean?

It means that depending on what version of Sodium you're using, you may no longer be reciving support or updates from the z1g Project.

- **EOL**: Your version (if there is any problems) won't be fixed or reveiwed by z1g and you should update.
- **Phasing Out**: You should update Sodium soon before it becomes an EOL release.
- **LTS**: Long-term support, meaning your current version is fine, but updating is still recommended for fixes and new features.
- **Stable**: A stable release of Sodium.
- **Current**: The latest version of Sodium.
- **Development**: These versions are yet to be completed and are in the works.
