Learn how to setup Sodium on a Static Host such as Cloudflare Pages

## Setup & installation

<Steps>
  <Step>First you need to fork this repository.</Step>
  <Step>
    In your forked repository navigate to
    `sodium-static\public\ultra\ultra.config.js` and set the bare to a public
    bare server like `https://tomp.app` if you are confused what to put just
    Comment out the bare array then uncomment out the public bare it will tell
    you in the config what to do. Also you must repeat this step for
    `sodium-static\public\dyn\dyn.config.js` except it will be easier since its
    not in a array.
  </Step>
  <Step>Next you need go to whichever host you will be using.</Step>
  <Step>
    Step 4 is to Select the repository that you are gonna be hosting (Hopefully
    its sodium!)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Next if your Host supports this Set the output directory to
    `sodium-static\public\` and **DO NOT MAKE IT RUN `npm install` or `npm
    start` AS THIS WILL START AN HTTP SERVER WHICH IS NOT SUPPORTED BY STATIC
    HOSTS**
  </Step>
  <Step>Step 6 is to then run and enjoy your experience with Sodium!</Step>
</Steps>
