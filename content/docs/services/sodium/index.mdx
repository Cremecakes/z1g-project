## Features

Sodium has various Features that work great and were tested on some enrolled Chromebooks recently (Shoutout xN1ghtmare for testing)
Some of the features of sodium are:

- Auto-Stealth Pages (Loads the pages within the current page you are on instead of loading the page classicly with the example.com/sw/)
- Tab Cloaking - Changeable Title, Icon, and About:blank cloaking
- Multiple Themes - Refreshed (default), Amoled, Mocha, Dark, Legacy Dark, and Festive
- Performance Metrics - Tells you how much data was transfered when loading the page, the latency it took to reach the bare server and route the request, and the FPS of the page
- Battery & Time Displays **_NOTE ONLY WORKS ON CHROMIUM-BASED BROWSERS_**
- Wide Variety of games! - Total of 55 Games and 15 Apps!
- CSS Editor - Uses CodeMirror CSS Editor and is still in the works!
- Emergency Switch Feature - A functional bindable keybind with a URL that when you press the button exits the page you are on and redirects to that URL!
- Plugins - Sodium has a ton if addons ranging from adblockers to io hacks! Vencord is built into Ultraviolet when loading discord
- Customizable! - Sodium has tons of other customization options for you to play with!
