Sodium was submitted to the Titanium Network Proxathon in 2023!

## Features

Sodium has various Features that work great and were tested on some enrolled Chromebooks recently (Shoutout xN1ghtmare for testing)
Some of the features of sodium are:

- **Auto-Stealth Pages**: Loads the pages within the current page you are on instead of loading the page classicly with the `example.com/sw/`
- **Tab Cloaking**: Changeable Title, Icon, and About:blank cloaking
- **Multiple Themes**: Refreshed (default), Amoled, Mocha, Dark, Legacy Dark, and Festive
- **Performance Metrics**: Tells you how much data was transfered when loading the page, the latency it took to reach the bare server and route the request, and the FPS of the page
- **Device Statuses**: Displays battery status and time (ONLY WORKS ON CHROMIUM-BASED BROWSERS)
- **Games & Apps**: List of games and apps with up to 70 to choose from
- **CSS Editor**: Uses CodeMirror CSS Editor (work in progress)
- **Panic Mode Feature**: A functional bindable keybind with a URL that when you press the button exits the page you are on and redirects to that URL!
- **Plugins**: Sodium has a ton if addons ranging from adblockers to io hacks! Vencord is built into Ultraviolet when loading discord
- **Customizable**: Sodium has tons of other customization options for you to play with and truly make the experience yours

  <Callout title="Banned hosts">
    If you are on Replit, Glitch, Heroku (or any other host that doesn't allow
    proxies), this repository will most likely get your deployment flagged.
