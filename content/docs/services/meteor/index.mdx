The modern interception proxy you've been waiting for.

Meteor is a web proxy powered by service workers that intercepts HTTP requests and routes them through a Wisp server using bare-mux.

## Installation
Meteor is a client-side JavaScript library. You can install it in your application in one of two ways:

<steps>
  <step>
    Build Meteor's scripts by first cloning the repository, installing packages (`pnpm install`),  running `pnpm build` and copy the files in the `dist/` folder into a `meteor` folder in your application's folder.
  </step>
  <step>
    `meteorPath` is exported from the `@z1g-project/meteor` [NPM package](https://npmjs.com/package/@z1g-project/meteor), which resolves to a path in `node_modules` of built Meteor scripts. You can use this however you serve static directories in your backend framework.

    Express:
    ```js
      import express from 'express'
      import { meteorPath } from '@z1g-project/meteor'

      const app = express()
      app.use("/meteor/", express.static(meteorPath)
    ```

    Fastify:
    ```js
      import Fastify from 'fastify'
      import fastifyStatic from '@fastify/static'
      import { meteorPath } from '@z1g-project/meteor'

      Fastify()
      .register(fastifyStatic, {
        root: meteorPath,
        prefix: '/meteor/'
      })
    ```
  </step>
</steps>

## Usage
Once you have the scripts served, register your service worker and set your transport on your frontend.

```js
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')
    BareMux.SetTransport(
      "EpxMod.EpoxyClient", // replace with your transport
      { wisp: `wss://wisp-server-here.com` } // replace with the url of your wisp server
    ) 
  })
}

// After a button click or other event:
window.location.href = __meteor$config.prefix + __meteor$config.codec.encode("https://example.com") // replace url with the (full) url you want to navigate to
```

More in-depth usage and configuration can be found in the Wiki.

## Testing and development
Running `pnpm demo` will serve a basic UI to test Meteor, along with a dev server that watches for changes in the source code and re-builds accordingly.
